# nonlinear-dimensionality-reduction
This repository contains code I wrote for COMS 4771 (Machine Learning) at Columbia University. The code performs nonlinear dimensionality reduction. 

The dependencies needed to run this code are:
1. scikit-learn
2. scipy
3. matplotlib
4. numpy
5. seaborn
6. nltk
